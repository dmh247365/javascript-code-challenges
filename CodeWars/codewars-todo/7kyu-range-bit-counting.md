## 7kyu - Range Bit Counting

### Question
You are given two numbers `a` and `b` where `0 ≤ a ≤ b`. Imagine you construct an array of all the integers from `a` to `b` inclusion. You need to count the number of `1`s in the binary representations of all the numbers in the array.

#### Examples input/output:

```
for a =2 and b = 7, the output should be `11`.  

Given a =2 and b = 7 the array is:[2,3,4,5,6,7]. Converting the numbers to binary, we get [10,11,100,101,110,111], which contains 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11 1s.
```
