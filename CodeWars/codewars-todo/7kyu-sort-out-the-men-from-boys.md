## 7kyu - Sort Out The Men From Boys

### Question
Now that the competition gets tough it will Sort out the men from the boys.

Men are the Even numbers and Boys are the odd.

* Return an array/list where Even numbers come first then odds.
* Since, Men are stronger than Boys. Then Even numbers in ascending order while odds in descending.
* Array/list size is at least 4.
* Array/list numbers could be a mixture of positives, negatives.
* Have no fear, it is guaranteed that no Zeros will exist.
* Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur, so (duplications are not included when separating)

#### Examples input/output:

```js
menFromBoys({7, 3, 14, 17}) => return({14, 17, 7, 3})
// Since, {14} is the even number, so its first, then the odds in order {17, 7, 3}.

menFromBoys({-94, -99, -100, -99, -96, -99}) => return({-100, -96, -94, -99})
// Duplications removed, since {-100, -96, -94} are the even numbers so put in ascending order, then odds in descending.

menFromBoys({49, 818, -282, 900, 928, 281, -282, -1}) => return({-282, 818, 900, 928, 281, 49, -1})
